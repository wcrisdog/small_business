└── Writeup_Chengrui Wang.pdf

Writeup_Chengrui Wang.pdf is the final paper, with introduction following the abstract directly (explicit "Introduction" wording omitted conforming to rules by AEA).

"Raw" folder includes all raw datasets, three analysis python notebooks and two empty folders "graph"/"table" for analysis needs.

"Worked" folder stores what I get after running the three notebook snippet, including tables in .tex format, graphs and datasets created in middle steps.

Note that more instructions and explanations are included in the python notebook, but if you have any question, contact me at vincentwcr041219@gmail.com.
