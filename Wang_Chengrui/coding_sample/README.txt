In this coding sample I attached one paper titled “DIRT_The Distributed Intelligent Replicator Toolkit”, submitted and accepted to a computer science journal before. 

Inside the paper I attached the github link which could also be retrieved through: http://github.com/aaronwalsman/dirt

Note that this repo is under the name of my instructor, while I contributed to terrain structure, water flow, climate system and other resources dynamics with JAX in PYTHON, which is the core of the paper, making me the first author.

Please do not distribute as we are pushing this on further analyzing human intelligence.
