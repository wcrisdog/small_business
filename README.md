### Small Business Training Program

This is the full analysis folder of the small business training program, which should have the following tree structure. If any file is missing, go to the GitHub repo for reference: https://github.com/wcrisdog/small_business

"Raw" folder includes all raw datasets, three analysis python notebooks and two empty folders "graph"/"table" for analysis needs. Only changing the working directory in each notebook will enable you to replicate the whole analysis.

"Worked" folder stores what I get after running the three notebook snippet, including tables in .tex format, graphs and datasets created in middle steps.

Note that more instructions and explanations are included in the python notebook, but if you have any question, contact me at vincentwcr041219@gmail.com.
